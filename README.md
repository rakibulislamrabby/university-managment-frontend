# University Management System - Frontend

A comprehensive university management system built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components, featuring role-based authentication for Students, Faculty, and Administrators.

## Features

### Authentication System
- **Role-based authentication** with three user types:
  - **Students**: Access to enrollment, courses, payments, and academic records
  - **Faculty**: Course management, grading, and student information access
  - **Administrators**: Complete system management and user administration

### Current Implementation
- Static data authentication (ready for API integration)
- Protected routes with role-based access control
- Responsive dashboard layouts for each user role
- Profile management with role-specific editable fields
- Session persistence using localStorage

## Demo Accounts

### Student Account
- **Email**: `john.doe@student.university.edu`
- **Password**: `student123`

### Faculty Account
- **Email**: `sarah.johnson@university.edu`
- **Password**: `faculty123`

### Administrator Account
- **Email**: `emily.davis@university.edu`
- **Password**: `admin123`

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Custom context-based system
- **State Management**: React Context API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd university-management-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

### Login Process
1. Visit the application homepage
2. You'll be redirected to the login page
3. Use one of the demo accounts or click the demo buttons to auto-fill credentials
4. After successful login, you'll be redirected to the appropriate dashboard

### Navigation
- Each user role has a customized sidebar with relevant menu items
- The navbar shows user information and provides logout functionality
- All routes are protected and will redirect unauthorized users

### Profile Management
- Users can view their complete profile information
- Certain fields are editable based on role permissions:
  - **Students**: Contact details, emergency contact, present address, blood group
  - **Faculty**: Contact details, emergency contact, present address
  - **Administrators**: Contact details, emergency contact, present address

## Data Models

### User Roles
- `ADMIN`: System administrators with full access
- `FACULTY`: Teaching staff with course and student management access
- `STUDENT`: Students with access to enrollment and academic features

### Core Models
- **User**: Base authentication model with role and profile references
- **Student**: Complete student profile with academic and personal information
- **Faculty**: Faculty profile with teaching and academic details
- **Admin**: Administrator profile with system management information

## API Integration Ready

The authentication system is designed to easily integrate with backend APIs:

- **AuthService**: Centralized service class ready for API calls
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript interfaces matching backend models
- **Error Handling**: Structured error handling for API responses
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading states for async operations

### Integration Steps
1. Replace mock data in `src/data/mockData.ts` with API calls
2. Update `src/services/authService.ts` to use real HTTP requests
3. Implement proper token management (JWT, etc.)
4. Add error boundaries and proper error handling
